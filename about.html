<p>My name is William Mittard and I'm originally from the South of England. In 2014 I moved to U.S to pursue my undergraduate degree in Business Administration. Upon graduation me and my wife Olivia moved to Carmel, Indiana, which is where we now reside. This is my career transformation journey from being an Account Executive to becoming a Software Engineer. </p>
